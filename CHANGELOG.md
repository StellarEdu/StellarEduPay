# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Investigated duplicate sync bug (#731)**: Audited `syncAllPayments` in `paymentController.js` for the reported double `syncPaymentsForSchool` call and `ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT` crash. Confirmed the code already calls `syncPaymentsForSchool` exactly once, sends a single response, and correctly passes `summary` to the audit log. No code change required.

### Added

- **Student Quota Enforcement (#680)**: Schools can now enforce per-school student registration limits via the `maxStudents` field. Quota is checked on both single student registration and bulk imports. Returns `403 STUDENT_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` when limit is reached.
- **Asset Validation in Payment Instructions (#682)**: `GET /api/payments/instructions/:studentId` now validates the optional `?asset=` query parameter against the school's accepted assets. Returns `400 ASSET_NOT_ACCEPTED` with a list of supported assets if the requested asset is not accepted.
- **Comprehensive Fee Adjustment Engine Tests (#681)**: Added extensive test coverage for `feeAdjustmentEngine` rule interactions, including sequential application of multiple rules, clamping of negative fees, and deterministic behavior verification.

### Changed

- **School Model**: Added `maxStudents` field (Number, default: 10000) to enforce student registration quotas per school.
- **Student Registration**: `POST /api/students` now checks school quota before creating a student.
- **Bulk Student Import**: `POST /api/students/bulk` now enforces quota with partial result support—rows exceeding the quota are marked as failed with `STUDENT_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` code.

### Fixed

- **Payment Instructions Clarity**: Parents requesting payment instructions for unsupported assets now receive a clear error message with a list of accepted assets, preventing confusion when payments are rejected.

### Documentation

- Added `CHANGELOG.md` following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) format.
- Updated `README.md` to link to `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Known Issues

- Rate limit persistence requires Redis configuration; without it, counters reset on server restart
- MongoDB replica set required for multi-document transactions (not supported on standalone instances)
- Stellar Horizon API rate limits constrain sync throughput during high-volume periods. This is now bounded and documented rather than open-ended: polling draws from a coordinated cross-school request budget spent in priority order, with measured maximum sync-delay figures and configuration guidance in [docs/horizon-rate-limits.md](docs/horizon-rate-limits.md). Operators running more than one replica must set `HORIZON_POLL_REPLICA_COUNT`, and should re-validate the published figures against their own Horizon instance before quoting them contractually.

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading to Unreleased

#### Breaking Changes

None in this release.

#### Non-Breaking Changes

1. **Student Quota**: If you have schools with more than 10,000 students, update the `maxStudents` field in the School document to reflect your actual limit.
2. **Asset Validation**: Clients calling `GET /api/payments/instructions/:studentId?asset=USDC` will now receive a `400` error if USDC is not in the school's accepted assets. Update client code to handle this error gracefully.

#### Migration Steps

1. Update backend to latest version
2. Run database migrations (if any)
3. Restart backend services
4. Update frontend to handle new error codes: `STUDENT_QUOTA_EXCEEDED`, `ASSET_NOT_ACCEPTED`
